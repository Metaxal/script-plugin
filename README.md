The script plugin is a tool for DrRacket which allows to quickly and easily extend DrRacket features, without having to restart it.
The scripts are automatically accessible from a new menu in DrRacket.
See the docs for how to make a script.

It is already packed with a number of useful such scripts:
* abstract: When you want to replace an expression with a variable ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgjAZd4eBBY )
* author-date: Insert some combination of author-date-license strings in your files
* bookmarks: Add bookmarks in your files to quickly navigate between lines
* color-chooser: Pick a color graphically and insert it in DrRacket's current file
* complete-word: Word completion from a give user dictionary
* def-signature: Display the signature of a procedure or a form on top of DrRacket (predates DrRacket blue-box feature, but may still be useful when the file does not compile)
* dynamic-abbrev: Word completion for the words in the current file
* git: Unix-specific (uses xterm); Modify to suit your needs")
* goto-line: A simple example to tweak DrRacket (but DrRacket already has this feature)
* gui-tools: A simple example on how to add gui definitions
* indent-table: Indent your line like a table. Useful for `let's and `define's ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJjVREsgnvA )
* insert-lambda: Simple example of string insertion (for this particular case you may prefer to use a keybindings file though)
* my-functions: Simple example on how to build submenus for your scripts
* open-collects: Shortcut to open a racket/collects file in DrRacket
* open-dir: Open the OS explorer in the directory of the file
* open-terminal: Opens a terminal in the directory of the current file. Unix specific 
* regexp-replace: Replace strings with regular expressions in DrRacket. Some default templates included.
